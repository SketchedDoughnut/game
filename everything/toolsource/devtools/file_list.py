'''
This is a tool used during build, which lists every file to exist.
It then dumps this data into a file, named file_list.json. This is important, because each file
in that json file is checked to make sure it exists. If any files do not exist, then that means the install went wrong.
Therefore, it is most important to call on this before releasing a build!
