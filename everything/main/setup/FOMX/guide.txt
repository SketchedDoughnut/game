If your curious, FOMX stands for:
- File 
- Overwriting
- Management
- X-press

Here is how data is formatted:
{
    "description": "This is an example message about a small release message! This is in the body of the release.",
    "file_details": [["file.py", "normal"], ["file.exe", "binary"]],
    "file_paths": ["everything/blah/blah/blah", "everything/blah"]
}

Explenation:
- description:
    - is used to display in console IF THE USER WANTS TO.
- file_details:
    - is used for the file names, and what type of read/write mode they need (read binary and write binary, normal read and write, etc).
- file_paths:
    - is used to get the file path BESIDES the file itself. So file_details[0] needs to be added onto this.
