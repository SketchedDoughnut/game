'''
This is the system responsible for checking for updates, and initiating them.
It has its own pygame interface and whatnot, and is rather simple.
The nature of this file (and any others equipped with a crash handler) is that the
entirety of the code is inside of a try, except. So, if it breaks, the crash handler
can log that to a file then exit smoothly.
