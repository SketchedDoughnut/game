- MAIN TODO
  - Clean up RELEASES
  - Find out how the tag system works

  - add dev feature using old installer system in order to get the most recent files (also disclose the risks with this)

  - Update installer
    - More details about what abs path means (give active example of where file is located?
    - Advise against using paths with space in them
    - More instructions overall
    
  - Update rhythm game
    - Update score handling
      - have a health handler that will make you lose if you miss too many notes
      - add high score.json, display that on end screen ----------------------------------------------
      - update high score if higher is reached -------------------------------------------------------
    - Add pausing?
    - add volume controls
    - divider lines upwards lining up with letters (between letter and zone) - NOTE: HAS TO FADE
    - choose better colors for end-screen
    - fix GIT LFS -> unkown WAVE format error, something with how it treats the file endings (made discussion post)
