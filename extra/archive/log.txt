This was the old requirements.txt, which has since been shaved down on 10/18/24 to only include the necessary modules. 
This was done because the code needs to create a virtual environment, installing the dependencies within it.
the Pipfile was moved as well since it was part of generating the Pipfile.lock, and a new one is now going to be used.

The flash installer was moved into the archive as it is outdated and does not work with the new systems. That is not to say
it is not completely viable, but for now it will not be used. Thank you for your services, flash installer :salute:
